Founded in Minneapolis in 1997, Sub Zero has emerged as the premier men's
      club ultimate team in the state of Minnesota. Throughout the years, we
      have competed on both national and international stages. We compete in the
      USA Ultimate Club Series in pursuit of a National Championship, traveling
      across the country to participate in regular season and postseason
      tournaments.
</p> <p>
Every spring, our team hosts tryouts where hundreds of players compete to
      earn a roster spot. Sub Zero is composed of members of our local
      community, current college players, and graduates from regional programs
      including Carleton College, St. Olaf College, the University of Minnesota,
      and the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

In High School, Gary played tennis and soccer; Steve ran track, mainly the
      400. One from a small Iowa city, the other from southern Wisconsin, this
      dynamic duo met in the dorms of their small Minnesota college freshman
      year and history was made. At first, they picked up Ultimate just to meet
      people. They soon found that, with their sports background, they had an
      edge on the competition. Gary excelled at throwing, Steve had phenomenal
      speed. Gary brought strategy to the huddle, Steve brought intensity. They
      enjoyed their college years, and even carried their team to Nationals
      senior year as co-captains. School ended and, as products of a fine
      liberal arts education, they had no job and no idea what they wanted to do
      with their lives. They moved to the cities and kicked around for the
      summer. Ultimate was on their radar, but the scene was chaotic back then,
      and these two balked at committing. Their skills did not go unnoticed,
      though. The players you think of as founders all knew Gary (the outgoing
      one) and respected his disc skills. When the time came, Gary called a
      meeting, forcing into the same room three unlikely groups: CUT boys who
      followed lockstep behind Lonsdorf, crusty old network of vets stuck in
      their ways, and the aimless "goofy" liberal arts graduates. In the meeting
      that ensued, by force of charisma alone, Gary and Steve forged these
      elements into Sub Zero.Then Steve found a job opportunity in New York City
      in journalism that he could not pass up. His friend gone, Gary moved out
      West, playing three years with Sockeye. They never stayed to see the team
      they created flourish. They live on though. You see Gary and Steve on
      every Sub Zero jersey and disc. That’s right! The feared Snowmen that now
      serve as our logo are none other than the two true founding members of Sub
      Zero. <br> <b>Steve is the one on the right.</b> </p> </section>  </main> </body></html>
